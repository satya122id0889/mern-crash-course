## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+) and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running locally or MongoDB Atlas account

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-crash-course.git
cd mern-crash-course
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
# In backend directory, create a .env file with:
touch .env
```

Add these variables to your `.env` file:
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

4. Run the application
```bash
# From project root directory, run both frontend and backend:
npm run dev
```

This uses `concurrently` to run both servers simultaneously.
